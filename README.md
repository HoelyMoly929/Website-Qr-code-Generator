# Website-Qr-code-Generator

## 💡 Casual / Learning Journal Style

I built this small project while learning how Node.js works. It’s a simple Website QR Code Generator that takes a URL and turns it into a QR code.
The main goal wasn’t to make something fancy, but to understand the basics — how to set up a Node.js server,  use npm packages, and send responses.

What I learned:

- How npm packages simplify tasks like generating QR codes

- How to structure a small Node.js project

This was a fun and quick experiment to get comfortable with the Node.js environment.
